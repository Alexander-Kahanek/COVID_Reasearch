# COVID Reasearch Project

This project is currently being worked on.

# Files

All the data is stored on a virtual machine, so it will not be posted to github.

* filter_scripts.py is a script I made to filter through compressed json files, and create a cleaner json file.

* json_2_csv_script.py is a script I made to take the json file from the above script, and clean the data down into a csv file.

* flair_script.py is a script built to run the tweets through flairs' models and output the data into a json file
  + need to seperate this script into one script per flair model
  + need to build a script to take finished json files from above, and combine into one big json file

MORE TO COME!
